Good. Then what you need now is a clean master prompt you can paste directly into Replit AI so it builds the correct architecture from the beginning.

Below is a structured instruction block. Copy everything between the lines and paste it into Replit.

✅ PASTE INTO REPLIT AI

⸻

I am building a minimalist Progressive Web App (PWA) called Eremos.

Purpose:
A structured solitude and Scripture meditation journaling app based on a 365-day reading plan and rotating Desert-style examination questions.

This is a personal tool (not commercial). It must be:
	•	Minimalist
	•	Distraction-free
	•	Local-first (IndexedDB storage)
	•	Offline capable
	•	Installable as a PWA
	•	No login required
	•	No backend initially
	•	Autosave on every keystroke
	•	One prompt per screen (no scrolling through multiple prompts)

⸻

CORE CONCEPT

Daily structure:
	1.	Morning Prayer (static text)
	2.	Reading Checklist (from 365-day CSV)
	3.	Scripture Meditation (3 prompts, rotating weekly from a structured pool)
	4.	Desert Examination (3 prompts, rotating category weekly)
	5.	Mood Naming (1–10 scale + short text)
	6.	Free-form Prayer
	7.	Closing Prayer (static)

Each prompt must be presented one at a time in a turn-by-turn wizard flow.

Progress indicator should show current step number out of total steps.

Autosave must occur on every input change.

⸻

TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS
	•	Next.js (React)
	•	Tailwind CSS for styling
	•	Dexie.js for IndexedDB
	•	PWA enabled (manifest + service worker)
	•	Works offline
	•	Clean white background, black text
	•	No gamification
	•	No streaks
	•	No notifications

⸻

ROTATION LOGIC

There are 7 rotating Desert categories:
	1.	Logismoi
	2.	Humility
	3.	Prayer Examination
	4.	Speech
	5.	Detachment
	6.	Acedia
	7.	Daily Rhythm

Rotation logic:

processIndex = (planDay - 1) % 7

Scripture Meditation always runs daily.

Scripture Meditation prompts rotate weekly from 3 pools:

Pool 1 (Revelation):
	•	What does this reveal about God’s character?
	•	What does this show about how God acts?
	•	What aspect of God do I resist here?
	•	What would change if I believed this about God?

Pool 2 (Exposure):
	•	What does this expose in me?
	•	Where do I resist this truth?
	•	What part of me is unsettled by this passage?
	•	What fear in me does this address?

Pool 3 (Response):
	•	What must be surrendered?
	•	What obedience is implied here?
	•	What would trust look like in response?
	•	Where is repentance needed?

Weekly rotation:
weekIndex = Math.floor((planDay - 1) / 7) % poolLength

Select prompt at weekIndex from each pool.

DESERT EXAMINATION QUESTIONS (3 PER CATEGORY)

Logismoi:
	•	What thought has most occupied my mind today?
	•	Did I entertain it or resist it?
	•	What desire is beneath it?

Humility:
	•	Where did I seek recognition?
	•	Was I disturbed when overlooked or corrected?
	•	Did I judge another inwardly?

Prayer Examination:
	•	Was my prayer distracted?
	•	Did I cling to anxiety in prayer?
	•	Did prayer soften me afterward?

Speech:
	•	Was what I said necessary?
	•	Did my words seek approval?
	•	Did my speech create peace or agitation?

Detachment:
	•	What loss or inconvenience disturbed me?
	•	What am I clinging to?
	•	Would I remain at peace if misunderstood?

Acedia:
	•	Did I crave distraction?
	•	Did I resent my place or task?
	•	Did discouragement distort reality?

Daily Rhythm:
	•	What thought greeted me this morning?
	•	What interior disturbance surfaced today?
	•	Where did I resist humility?

READING PLAN

Load reading plan from CSV file with columns:

Day
Torah/History
Wisdom
Prophets
New Testament

Display reading references as checklist cards.

Allow user to mark each as completed.

⸻

DATA STORAGE STRUCTURE

Use IndexedDB via Dexie.

Tables:

readingPlan
sessions
responses
moodEntries

Each session stores:
	•	date
	•	planDay
	•	completion status

Each response stores:
	•	sessionId
	•	questionTextSnapshot
	•	answerText
	•	category
	•	updatedAt

Autosave on every keystroke.

⸻

UI REQUIREMENTS
	•	One prompt per screen
	•	Large text input
	•	Back / Next buttons
	•	Small progress indicator
	•	No scrolling across multiple prompts
	•	Reading panel accessible via modal without losing session progress
	•	Resume incomplete session automatically

⸻

MORNING PRAYER (STATIC TEXT)

[PASTE YOUR MORNING PRAYER HERE]

⸻

CLOSING PRAYER

Placeholder: simple “Amen.” (can be expanded later)

⸻

Generate:
	1.	Full project structure
	2.	PWA configuration
	3.	IndexedDB schema
	4.	Wizard session engine
	5.	Reading plan loader
	6.	Rotation logic
	7.	Autosave logic

Make code clean, modular, and minimal.

END OF REPLIT PROMPT

⸻

Now a critical note:

When you paste this into Replit, do NOT immediately start tweaking styling. Let it generate the architecture first.

Once it builds the structure, come back here and tell me:
	•	What it generated
	•	Any errors
	•	What feels confusing

Then we refine.

We will build this carefully, not chaotically.
